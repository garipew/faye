# What is it?
Faye is a terminal-based file explorer.

## Usage
Faye can be executed by itself, to open the current directory
```
faye
```

Or, alternatively, the path to the starting directory can be set on the first argument
```
faye <path>
```
In this case, the length of path follows the default on linux and defaults to 4096 characters. 

## Milestones
[x] Display files of current directory in screen
[x] Move selector over files
[x] Open/Expand directories
[x] Move backwards on directories
[ ] Change cwd on exit
