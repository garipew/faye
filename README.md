# What is it?
Faye is a terminal-based file explorer.

## Build
To build faye, use the build script
```
./build.sh
```

## Usage
After building it, faye can be executed by itself to open the current directory
```
faye
```

Or, alternatively, the path to the starting directory can be set by the first argument
```
faye <path>
```

Check faye milestones [here](ROADMAP.md).
